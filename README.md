The "Wine Quality Prediction" aims to build a supervised classification model and to predict the quality of wine. Properties such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, sugar levels, and other compounds present in the wine, which can influence its taste, aroma, and overall quality.

Machine learning models like regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are employed to analyse the historical wine datasets to train models that can predict wine quality accurately. These models are typically evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure their reliability and performance. Additionally, a cross-validation technique (StratifiedKFold is implemented to enhance the algorithm's accracy.

Ultimately, this system enables a wine quality recommendation engine, selecting the best-performing machine learning model to provide accurate quality predictions.
